## **1 INTRODUCTION** ##

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by the inability of the body to produce or use insulin properly, resulting in high levels of glucose in the blood. Early detection and management of diabetes can prevent complications such as blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage, and heart disease.

In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. 
Another 460,000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths.

## **Outline of the problem to solve** ##

* Objective: Develop a predictive model for accurately forecasting the likelihood of developing diabetes based on health-related features.
* Method: Utilize machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive dataset to build the predictive model.
* Impact on Healthcare: Assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at higher risk of diabetes. Enable proactive healthcare interventions like lifestyle modifications and targeted monitoring.
* Promoting a Data-Driven Approach in Healthcare: Showcase technology's potential in improving health outcomes. Empower healthcare professionals and individuals with valuable data-derived insights.
* Ultimate Goal: Contribute to a healthier society by utilizing machine learning for early diabetes risk assessment and promoting a proactive healthcare approach.

## **2 SOLUTION STRATERGY** ##

The problem solution follows the following steps:

**Step 1 Data Description :**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included such as Glucose, blood pressure, insulin, and  BMI in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

**Step 2 Data Filtering :**

The dataset acquired from the government website was initially found to be complete, containing no missing values or apparent data discrepancies. As a result, there was no need for imputation or handling missing values. The dataset was considered ready for further analysis without requiring any additional steps to address missing data.

However, it's important to note that even though the dataset had no missing values initially, it's a good practice to conduct a thorough review and validation to ensure data integrity and completeness before proceeding with the analysis.

**Step 3 Data Exploration :**

Data Loading and Inspection: Load the dataset and examine its structure, dimensions, and features.

Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical features to understand their central tendencies and variability.

Descriptive Analysis: Explore the distribution and summary of each feature, identifying outliers, unusual patterns, or missing values.

Visualization: Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to represent feature distributions and relationships between variables.

Correlation Analysis: Examine the correlation between features to identify potential multicollinearity and relationships that can aid in feature selection.

Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Analyze individual features (univariate) and the relationships between pairs of features (bivariate) to understand their behavior and interactions.

**Step 4 Data Analysis :**

-- Domain Understanding : 

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (sugar).

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels by allowing cells to take in glucose from the blood. Glucose is the primary source of energy for cells.

Various factors increase the risk of developing diabetes, including family history, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, age, ethnicity, and gestational diabetes during pregnancy.

Symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing. Long-term unmanaged diabetes can lead to complications affecting the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.

Diagnosis involves measuring blood glucose levels. Regular monitoring is essential for managing diabetes, often using devices like glucometers to measure blood sugar levels.

Preventative measures include maintaining a healthy weight, regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and regular medical check-ups for early detection and intervention.

**Step 5 Data Preprocessing and Preparation :**

Standard scaling helps gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) converge faster and more reliably, as features are on a similar scale.

All features have an equal influence on the model, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process due to their larger magnitude.

Many machine learning models, such as support vector machines, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis, are sensitive to feature scales. Standard scaling can improve the performance and stability of these models.

**Step 6 Machine Learning Model:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable classification model that predicts whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes or not based on specific health-related features. The model will classify individuals into two categories: "Diabetic" and "Non-Diabetic."

The target variable will be binary:

"1" indicates the individual is at risk of developing diabetes (Diabetic)
"0" indicates the individual is not at risk (Non-Diabetic)

Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest will be evaluated to determine the most suitable model for diabetes prediction.

* Deployment transitions a project from development/testing to the live production environment.
* Goal: Make the project fully operational for intended users and stakeholders.
* Successful deployment ensures smooth function and value delivery.

from the above graph, we can illustrate that a high glucose level indicates a person has more chance of diabetes.

The correlation coefficient between glucose levels and the presence of diabetes in patients indicates a strong positive correlation. The plot visually supports this, showcasing higher glucose levels in individuals identified as diabetic.

Understanding this strong positive correlation is vital, as elevated glucose levels are a hallmark of diabetes. It emphasizes the importance of glucose levels as a predictive feature in the diabetes prediction model, supporting the model's accuracy in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes based on this crucial health indicator.

The correlation between BMI and the presence of diabetes was found, indicating a moderate to strong positive correlation. The plot visually supports this, revealing higher BMI levels in individuals identified as diabetic. This suggests that higher BMI is associated with an increased likelihood of diabetes.

Understanding this correlation is crucial, as BMI is a well-established indicator of body composition and health. The strong correlation between BMI and diabetes further emphasizes the importance of considering BMI as a predictive feature in the diabetes prediction model. Including BMI alongside glucose levels enhances the model's accuracy in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes, providing a more comprehensive assessment of their diabetes risk.

## **5 Summary of limitations/challenges faced** ##

* Achieving an overall model accuracy of 81% is promising, it's important to note that accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture, especially in datasets or critical domains such as healthcare.

* The precision of 70% suggests that there is a significant false positive rate, meaning the model may incorrectly identify some individuals as diabetic. This could have serious implications in healthcare where false positives may lead to unnecessary interventions or anxiety for patients.

* Navigating the intricacies of the healthcare domain, specifically diabetes, can be daunting for individuals with an engineering background due to its complex nature. Diabetes involves multifaceted biological systems and medical intricacies that require specialized knowledge and a nuanced understanding of both the physiological and technological aspects.

* The healthcare industry faces significant challenges, particularly regarding the integration of advanced technologies that bring it closer to a human-centered approach while upholding the necessity for high accuracy in medical processes. Balancing these two objectives poses a complex dilemma for the industry.
