**1 INTRODUCTION** 

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by the inability of the body to produce or use insulin properly, resulting in high levels of glucose in the blood. Early detection and management of diabetes can prevent complications such as blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage, and heart disease.

In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. 
Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths.

**2 SOLUTION STRATERGY** 

Problem solution follows the following steps:

**Step 1 Data description :**

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included such as, Glucose, Bloodpressure, insuline and  BMI in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

**Step 2 Data Filtering :**
This step involves finding and removing the NaN value and unnecessary rows and columns that are not a part of the business. Removing the Outliers.

**Step 3 Data Analysis :**
This step follows the finding unique values, Data summary, co-relation of data.

**Step 4 Data Preparation:**
Spliting the data into test and train sets, Data Scaling involved.

**Step 5 Machine Learning Model:**
the aim of step 5 to train Machine learning model on various model like Linear Regression, decision tree, random forest and svm to find the best model suits.

**Step 6 Conclusion :**
In conclusion stage which the generation capacity model is tested using unseen data.

**3 DATA INSIGHTS** 

There are some Key details found that follows:

from above graph we can illustrate that from age between 25 to 45 we can clearly see that the number of patient is more so, female from that age category are not very care about the diabetes control level.
After age 45+, people are realize that improvement of health so, the number of patient is decrease.

There is some lucrative dashboard that is created which shows relation between parameter.

**4 CONCLUSION**

Overall, from parameter it found that glucose and age are the Prime factor for Diabetes.
